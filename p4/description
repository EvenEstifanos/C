In a Linux environment, a shell is a command-line interpreter that acts as an interface between the user and the operating system kernel. 
It allows users to execute commands, run programs, and manage files through text-based input. 

On startup, a "heading" is printed to indicate that Commando is running and a brief line is printed to indicate the presence of the help built-in.
Users can exit by typing the exit command.
Below is a demo of these feature.

>> ./commando
=== COMMANDO ver 2 ===
Re-using existing output directory 'commando-dir'
Type 'help' for supported commands
[COMMANDO]>> help
