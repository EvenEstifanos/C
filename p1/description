Mazes will be encoded in simple text files several of which are present in the project codepack in the data/ directory. An example is:

>> cat data/maze-simple2.txt
rows: 7 cols: 16
tiles:
################
#S             #
# ### ###### # #
# ### ##E  #   #
# ### #### ##  #
#              #
################

S marks the Start Tile where the search begins
E marks the End Tile which is the goal to be reached
# marks Wall tiles which are blocked and cannot be crossed
Spaces are Open tiles which can be traversed
The goal of the project is to create a program that will read this text file, construct and internal representation of the maze, 
use a BFS to determine paths to all other tiles, and then print out the shortest path from the Start to End tile. 
It is well summarized by a sample run.

>> ./mazesolve_main data/maze-simple2.txt 
maze: 7 rows 16 cols
      (1,1) start
      (3,8) end
maze tiles:
################
#S             #
# ### ###### # #
# ### ##E  #   #
# ### #### ##  #
#              #
################
SOLUTION:
maze: 7 rows 16 cols
      (1,1) start
      (3,8) end
